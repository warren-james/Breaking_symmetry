The results of this model suggest that our participants were sensitive to the probability information (see Figure 3).  In the Biased condition, the average participant fixated the most likely target 71.8% of the time (95% HDPI of |43.2%, 95.3%|), compared to 40.1% (95% HPDI of |23.3%, 60.3%|) in the symmetric condition. The width of these intervals reflects a high degree of uncertainty in fixed effects, due to the range of behaviours exhibited by participants. (These are shown in more detail in the supplementary material.) None-the-less, the HPDI on the difference between these two conditions, |-0.04, 0.53| is largely positive and we can be reasonably confident (p(diff > 0 | data ) =  0.924 ) that the most-likely target is fixated more frequently in the biased condition. The Ddistance between the square targets did not appear to have any consistent effect in the Symmetric condition, however there was a small decrease in fixations towards the “most likely” box when the boxes were far apart in the bias condition (dropping to 64.1% with a 95% HPDI of |34.5%, 94.4%|). The width of these intervals reflects the range of performance that was exhibited by participants (which can be seen in the supplementary material). However, this does show that participants generally made us of this probability information in order to decide where to fixate. 

We can now ask whether participants were more likely to make use of the optimal strategy when in the biased condition. We will use the same predictors as above, but this time, to predict the probability of participants fixating either of side boxes over the central box. A random observer, equally likely to look at any of the three boxes, would have a 66% chance of fixating a Side box. The results suggest that in the Biased condition, participants were more likely to fixate the side boxes than the central box in both the close (95.4%,HPDI of |85.9%, 99.9%|) and far (96.4%, HPDI of |86.9%, 100%|) conditions. This contrasts with  than when the participants were in the Symmetric condition (close; 83.9%, 95% H(HPDI of |60.3%, 98.5%|) for the close, and , far; 84.7%,( 95% HPDI of |62.8%, 99.9%|) for the far apart targets in the symmetric condition.. These results would suggest that the bias present in the Biased condition encouraged participants to fixate the side boxes more often. However, it does not suggest that adding this bias facilitated the use of the optimal strategy as participants did not appear to account for distance in an 	


## Hoop Sizes 
The data from this experiment were analysed using a Bayesian beta regression. The recorded data for standing positions were transformed to be between 0 and 1, with 0 representing the larger hoop and 1 representing the smaller hoop. Therefore, the central point would be 0.,5, and meaning anything above this value would demonstrate a shift in participant’s bhaviour away from the mid-point and towards the small hoop. The model included normalised hoop delta as a predictor to see how participants changed position with an increasing distance. This was also entered as a random effect by participant. 

The model results confirmed that participants in general had a bias towards standing closer to the small hoop (mean of 0.551, 95% HDPI of |0.506, 0.592|), which can be seen in Figure 7 (in red). However, this did not result in participants using the optimal strategy (i.e., there was no clear effect of distance on standing position). 


## Two Throws 
A Bayesian Beta regression was carried out to investigate whether participants performed the task in a more optimal way when they were given a chance to attempt both targets. The predictors included were No. of throws and Delta (hoop separation), and the predicted value was the normalised distance between centre (0) and side (1). A visual inspection of Figure 10 would appear to contradict this notion (i.e. participants had a tendency to stand more centrally when given two attempts), which was confirmed by the analysis. The results demonstrated that participants in the Two Throw condition were, in general, more likely to stand towards the centre (mean of 0.13, 95% HDPI of |0.3, 0.11|) compared to the One Throw condition (mean of 0.2, 95% HDPI of |0.21, 0.07|). The difference between the means of these two conditions was  0.07 (95% HPDI of |-0.03, 0.17|) which suggests there was a slight tendency for participants to stand further from the centre in the One Throw condition overall. There was no clear effect of Delta in either condition suggesting that participants were not making their decisions based on the separation of the two targets.
