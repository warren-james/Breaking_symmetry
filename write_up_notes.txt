general: 
	- Plots should show a subset 
	  - maybe 4 people
	  - best, worst, middle 2
	  - quintiles? 
	- full set can be on osf 

1: prob match
sort plot of fixation proportions with a lfa bar 
	- 1/2 done
model can remove really far point for now 
	- sort of done
model of last sensible point (lsp) and lfa 
	- prop_fixations ~ lsp/lfa + conditon 
* Do all this for accuracy as well 
* order participants by fixations to centre 
	- or score?
	- or any other bright ideas
	- accuracy?

2:hoop size 
First, use abs dist see if people move from centre
	- model beta dist 
Compare this to a control group of participants 
	- more of a reference point 
	- same model as before; with hoop similarity as predictor
* maybe mean dist from centre... or not? 
	- Try an use everything though 
	- for each point, dist to centre 
Second, are they going the right way 
	- normal dist fo standing pos (normalised)
Figure 9, remove dotted line
