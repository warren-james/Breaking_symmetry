Participant 17 on trial 11 had two 40p gambles, going by the pattern I've said that the right gamble was 40p, but will need to check this at a later date by finding the original document
However, for the analysis this shouldn't matter as they stood in the centre on this trial so the results will be the same

# need to check a few data points
will save the originals to my desktop for now
